# btctrendmonitor
Python program that monitors the trend of btc and relates with historical data to predicts the future trends of altcoins

Ensure that you have the required libraries (pandas, matplotlib, and cext) installed. You can install them using pip install pandas, pip install matplotlib, and pip install cext. Additionally, make sure you have a reliable internet connection to retrieve the historical price data from the Binance exchange.
Replace the altcoin markets list with the desired altcoin markets you want to analyze. Each altcoin market should be in the format 'ALT/USDT', where 'ALT' represents the altcoin symbol.
When you run this code, it will retrieve historical price data for Bitcoin and the selected altcoins, and then plot a visual representation of their price trends over time. The Bitcoin price trend will be plotted in orange, and the altcoin price trends will be plotted with different colors.
Feel free to customize the code further based on your analysis requirements or add additional features for more detailed comparisons or analysis.
